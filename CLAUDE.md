- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits.

For ai-specific changes like adding skills use the prefix `ai:`

The body of the commit messages must start with a summary of the reason followed by a bullet list of the main changes to the codebase.  Consider only the final state of the commit - do not mention normal development corrections.


## Planning

You must ask for the exact copy to be used unless it has been explicitly provided.
